# [CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERN] Singleton

This design pattern ensures that only one object of a class exists and that it only has a single point of access (for clients).

# BUILDING AND RUNNING

To build and run this example application showcasing the Singleton design pattern, create a `build` folder inside the `singleton` directory and run `cmake ..`. Afterwards, run `make Singleton`to build the application. 

Lastly, run the application by typing `./Singleton` in the `build` directory and observe the output.
